This is a simple program that adapts midi devices to linux event inputs. It allows the use of a midi controller as a general input device.

Right now, we support the AKAI LPD8 drum controller. hopefully we'll support more in the future.

TODO:
* add a configuration file format so this program can support more then one device type
* be more flexable about arguments, allow variable verbosity, etc...
